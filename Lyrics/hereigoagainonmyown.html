<h1>Here I Go Again</h1>
<p>
I don't know where I'm going<br>
But I sure know where I've been<br>
Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday<br>
And I've made up my mind<br>
I ain't wasting no more time<br>
</p>
<p>
Here I go again, here I go again<br>
Though I keep searching for an answer<br>
I never seem to find what I'm looking for<br>
Oh, Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on<br>
… 'Cause I know what it means<br>
To walk along the lonely street of dreams<br><br>
…
</p>
<p>  <h2>Chorus</h2><br>
Here I go again on my own<br>
Going down the only road I've ever known<br>
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone<br>
And I've made up my mind<br>
I ain't wasting no more time<br>
</p>
<p>
I'm just another heart in need of rescue<br>
Waiting on love's sweet charity<br>
And I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days<br>
… 'Cause I know what it means<br>
To walk along the lonely street of dreams<br><br>
…
</p>
<p><h2>Chorus</h2><br>
And here I go again on my own<br>
Going down the only road I've ever known<br>
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone<br>
And I've made up my mind<br>
I ain't wasting no more time<br>
</p>
<p>
But here I go again<br>
… Here I go again<br>
Here I go again<br>
Here I go<br>
… 'Cause I know what it means<br>
To walk along the lonely street of dreams<br><br>
…
</p>
<p><h2>Chorus</h2><br>
And here I go again on my own<br>
Going down the only road I've ever known<br>
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone<br>
