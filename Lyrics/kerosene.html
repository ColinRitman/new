<h1>Kerosene</h1>
<p>
I'm waitin' on the sun to set<br>
'Cause yesterday ain't over yet<br>
I started smoking cigarettes<br>
There's nothing else to do I guess<br>
Dusty roads ain't made for walking<br>
Spinning tires ain't made for stoppin'<br>
I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me<br>
</p>
<p><br>
I gave it everything I had<br>
And everything I got was bad<br>
Life ain't hard but it's too long<br>
To live it like some country song<br>
Trade the truth in for a lie<br>
Cheating really ain't a crime<br>
I'm giving up on love 'cause love's given up on me<br>
</p>
<p><br>
Forget you high society<br>
I'm soakin' it in kerosene<br>
Light 'em up and watch them burn<br>
Teach them what they need to learn, ha!<br>
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin'<br>
Ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin'<br>
Well I'm givin' up on love 'cause loves given up on me<br>
</p>
<p><br>
Now I don't hate the one who left<br>
You can't hate someone who is dead<br>
He's out there holdin' on to someone<br>
I'm holding up my smokin' gun<br>
I'll find somewhere to lay my blame<br>
The day she changes her last name<br>
Well, I'm givin' up on love 'cause love's given up on me<br>
Well, I'm givin' up on love, hey, love's given up on me<br>
</p>
