<h2>Round Here</h2>
  <p>
Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog<br>
Where no one notices the contrast of white on white<br>
And in between the moon and you<br>
The angels get a better view<br>
Of the crumbling difference between wrong and right<br>
Well, I walk in the air between the rain<br>
Through myself and back again<br>
Where? I don't know<br>
Maria says she's dying<br>
Through the door, I hear her crying<br>
Why? I don't know<br><br>
'Round here, we always stand up straight<br>
'Round here, something radiates<br><br>
  
Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand<br>
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis<br>
And she walks along the edge<br>
Of where the ocean meets the land<br>
Just like she's walking on a wire in the circus<br>
She parks her car outside of my house<br>
And takes her clothes off<br>
Says she's close to understanding Jesus<br>
And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood<br>
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous<br><br>
'Round here, we're carving out our names<br>
'Round here, we all look the same<br>
'Round here, we talk just like lions<br>
But we sacrifice like lambs<br>
'Round here, she's slipping through my hands<br><br>
  
Woah oh oh<br>
Sleeping children better run like the wind<br>
Out of the lightning dream<br>
Mama's little baby better get herself in<br>
Out of the lightning<br><br>
  
She says it's only in my head<br>
She says, shh, I know it's only in my head<br><br>
  
But the girl on the car in the parking lot<br>
Says, Man, you should try to take a shot<br>
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?<br>
Then she looks up at the building<br>
Says she's thinking of jumping<br>
She says she's tired of life<br>
She must be tired of something<br><br>
  
'Round here, she's always on my mind<br>
'Round here, hey man, got lots of time<br>
'Round here, we're never sent to bed early<br>
And nobody makes us wait<br>
'Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late<br>
I, I can't see nothin', nothin' 'round here<br>
You catch me if I'm fallin', you catch me if I'm fallin'<br>
Will you catch me? 'Cause I'm fallin' down on you<br>
I said I'm under the gun, 'round here<br>
I'm innocent, I'm under the gun, 'round here<br>
And I can't see nothin', nothin' 'round here<br>
