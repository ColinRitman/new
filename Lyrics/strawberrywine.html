<h1>Strawberry Wine</h1>
<p>
<h3>Verse 1</h3>
He was working through college<br>
On my grandpa's farm<br>
I was thirsting for knowledge<br>
And he had a car<br>
Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child<br>
One restless summer we found love growing wild<br>
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path<br>
It's funny how those memories they last<br>
  <br><h2>Chorus</h2>
Like strawberry wine and seventeen<br>
The hot July moon saw everything<br>
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet<br>
Green on the vine<br>
Like strawberry wine<br>
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Verse 2</h3>
I still remember<br>
When thirty was old<br>
And my biggest fear was September<br>
when he had to go<br>
A few cards and letters and one long distance call<br>
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall<br>
But year after year I come back to this place<br>
Just to remember the taste<br>
  <h2>Chorus</h2>
Of strawberry wine and seventeen<br>
The hot July moon saw everything<br>
My first taste of love, whoa-oh, bittersweet<br>
Green on the vine<br>
Like strawberry wine<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  <h2>Bridge</h2>
The fields have grown over now<br>
Years since they've seen the plow<br>
There's nothing time hasn't touched<br>
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence?<br>
I've been missing so much<br>
Yeah<br>
  <h2>Chorus</h2>
Strawberry wine and seventeen<br>
The hot July moon saw everything<br>
My first taste of love, whoa-oh bittersweet<br>
And green on the vine<br>
Like strawberry wine and seventeen<br>
The hot July moon saw everything<br>
My first taste of love, oh, bittersweet<br>
And green on the vine<br>
Like strawberry wine<br>
Strawberry wine<br>
Ooh<br>
Strawberry wine<br>
