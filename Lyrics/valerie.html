<p>
Well, sometimes
<br>I go out by myself
<br>And I look across the water
<br>And I think, of all the things, what you're doing?
<br>And in my head I paint a picture
</p>
<p><br>
Since I've come home
<br>Well, my body's been a mess
<br>And I miss your ginger hair
<br>And the way you like to dress
</p>
<p>
Oh, won't you come on over?
<br>Stop making a fool out of me
<br>Oh, why don't you come on over, Valerie?
<br>Valerie, yeah
<br>Valerie
<br>Valerie
</p>
<p><br>
Did you have to go to jail?
<br>Put your house out up for sale? Did you get a good lawyer?
<br>I hope you didn't catch a tan
<br>I hope you find the right man who'll fix it for you
</p>
<p>
And are you shopping anywhere? (Ah, ah)
<br>Change the color of your hair? (Ah, ah)
<br>And are you busy? (Ah, ah)
<br>
</p>
<p>
And did you have to pay that fine (ah, ah)
<br>That you were dodging all the time? (Ah, ah)
<br>Are you still dizzy? (Ah, ah)
<br>
</p>
<p><br>
But since I've come home
<br>Well, my body's been a mess
<br>And I miss your ginger hair
<br>And the way you like to dress
</p>

Oh, won't you come on over?
<br>Stop making a fool out of me
<br>Oh, why don't you come on over, Valerie?
<br>Valerie, yeah
